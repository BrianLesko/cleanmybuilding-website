# Clean My Building Website

Host a website that is easy to create new pages for. Keep it mostly simple and use HTML some CSS and a little javascript.

HTML - hypertext markup lanuage is the grandfather of websites. The entire structure is dependant on HTML
CSS - stylize aspects of your HTML like colors and rounding buttons etc
JS - JS is used for more hearty feature adds but creates a large amount of additional complexity
    here we implement a little JS two add two features:
    1. A back to top button that appears as your scroll down the page
    2. A method for rendering markdown documents, so that new website pages can be launched more quickly
        The current implementation uses URL hashes to determine what markdown file to render. 
        The alternative is using query parameters

My first public website built from scratch. 

This website is specifically Built for my Dad's company Crystal Clear Building Services. 

It acts as a proof of concept that a site can be quickly launched for nearly free.

I intent to add two other main components to this project. 
1. internal employee resources as an add on to this page - PTO requests implemented
2. Simple forms that use zero JS, just HTML and CSS - Completed 

## Roadmap

Increase the number and polish on the existing forms, create summaries that are sent out regularly. 

Create internal employee resources that are nearly fully autonomous and can be managed by CCBS employees rather than myself.

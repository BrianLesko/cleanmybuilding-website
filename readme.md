# Clean My Building Website

This repository stores the html, css, and javascript that makes up the public website [cleanmybuilding.co](cleanmybuilding.co). 

This site has two business functions:
- a minimal viable landing page for interested clients in janitorial services offered by Crystal Clear Building Services.
- A public access point for web services hosted for internal and employee use via the [employees](cleanmybuilding.co/employees/) page.

This site also demonstrates the following technical abilities:
- Self hosting a public website
- User authentication to private services
- html, css, and javascript

Here is a review of each coding language used to make this website: 
- HTML - hypertext markup lanuage is the grandfather of websites. The entire structure is dependant on HTML.
- CSS - stylize aspects of your HTML like colors and rounding buttons etc.
- JS - used to turn a markdown document into html.

Thanks for reading. This project was my first public, self-hosted website. I learned about deploying basic code to the web, using html, css, and javascript, the core languages used in web-development. This project has served as a gateway for creating more complex back end services that would not be easily possible on traditional website creators like wordpress. This site has been deployed since early 2024.
